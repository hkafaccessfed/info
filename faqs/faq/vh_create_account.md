# How do I get access to an HKAF VH account?



Providing you are collaborating or involved with an institution or research group subscribed to the HKAF, you may be eligible for an account.

You will need to contact any one of the following to request access:

- your local Service Desk;
- Identity Provider (IdP) administrator;
- Research Group Leader/Manager;
- Service Provider Leader/Manager.

VH accounts can be created for users who are associated with the organisation (e.g. collaborating in a research team). The organisation who creates the account for you is ultimately responsible for your access.
